seriView [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/larais/seriView/_apis/build/status/larais.seriView)](https://dev.azure.com/larais/seriView/_build/latest?definitionId=1)
==================

A very simple ASP.NET Core web app to view logs created by the [Serilog MSSqlServer Sink](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-mssqlserver).

The goal is not to have a full blown log analyzer, but to have a quick and simple way to look at the recent log events in the short term.
